The content of this project contains files that centre around Functions (also known as prototypes) and Nested Loops (which are loops within other loops, either single or indefinite).
The use of standard libraries was not permited; only __putchar and and a user defined head file "main.h"

File 0: Prints the string "__putchar" without the use of standard libraries.

File 1: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, making use of a while loop

File 2: Prints the alphabet in lower ten times, making use of a nested for loop; also restricted to using __putchar twice.

File 3: Checks for lowercase alphabet characters, returning 1 if lowercase, and 0 if not.

File 4: Checks whether character is upper or lowercase alphabet only, returning 1 for an alphabet, and 0 if anything but.

File 5: Prints the sign of an Ascii number: returned +1 if greater than zero, 0 when it is a zero number, and -1 if it is less than zero

File 6: Computes the absolute value of an integer, and returns the absolute value.

File 7: Prints the last digit of a number from the received value passed to it.

File 8: Prints ever minute of the day of Jack Bauer, a fictional TV character, from 00:00 to 23:59.

File 9: Prints the nine times multiplication table starting from zero.

File 10: Returns the result of two added integers of values passed to the formal parameters.

File 11: Prints all natural numbers from n to 98. Natural numbers are used to count 1, 2, 3, 4 ... and sometimes 0 is considered a natural number.
