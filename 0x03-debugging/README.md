This project directory contains files that will be used to test whether functions execute  their instructions successfully or not.
These files could either be the test cases themselves (identified with "main" in their file names), or the actual function code (identified as those starting with a number).
All of these were used with the intention of debugging: finding errors and discrepancies, and correcting them -- this was the intention of this project.
A leap year can cleanly be divided by 4. That is the code's logic test.
